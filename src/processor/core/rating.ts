 * - Calculating placement MMR for new players
 *
 * The system tries to place new players at appropriate skill levels quickly
 * rather than forcing everyone to start from the bottom.

 * appropriate skill levels instead of always starting them at the bottom.
 *
 * The skill proxy considers:
 * - Kill/Death ratio efficiency
 * - Damage dealt vs damage taken ratio

 * @returns Skill proxy value (0-2 range, where 1.0 = average skill)
